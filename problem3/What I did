Disclaimer: 
I have never used a Zyxel device before so I am not certain if there is anything else I would need to do to make the changes take effect.


Add the following to the Zyxel config:

interface vlan5
 port lag1
 vlan-id 5
 ip address 10.0.5.1 255.255.255.0
 upstream 1048576
 downstream 1048576
 mtu 1500
 type internal
 ip rip send version 2
 ip rip receive version 2
 ip ospf priority 1
 ip ospf cost 10
 ip dhcp-pool Network_Pool_VLAN5


ip dhcp pool Network_Pool_VLAN5
 network 10.0.5.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 10.0.5.1
 starting-address 10.0.5.100 pool-size 100
 first-dns-server 10.0.0.10
 second-dns-server 10.0.0.11
 third-dns-server 10.0.0.12
 lease 1 0 0
 dhcp-option 42 NTP_Server ip 10.0.0.15 10.0.0.16 10.0.0.17

As for the last requirement for only allowing vlan 5 to be able to access the internet, there are 2 ways that I see that this could be done, depending on if you want vlan 5 to have the same security policies as the other vlans or if you want vlan 5 to be specifically locked down and not able to talk to any other VLANs

1) Add interface vlan5 to the LAN zone, which will cause vlan 5 to inherit the same policies as other configured vlans 
zone LAN
 interface vlan5

2) Create a new zone with just vlan5 in it and create new policy to only allow access to the WAN zone
zone LAN2
 interface vlan5

secure-policy 5
 from LAN2
 to WAN
 log
 name VLAN5_to_WAN
 action allow
 activate
