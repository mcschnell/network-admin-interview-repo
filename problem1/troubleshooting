Logged into client machine using SSH key provided

Commands: {
   ifconfig -a
   nslookup
      server
}

Shows 2 DNS servers (10.0.0.235 and 10.0.0.89)
Can't ping either DNS server

Commands: {
   nslookup
   server 10.0.0.235
   www.google.com
   (returns correct result)
   server 10.0.0.89
   www.google.com
   (fails with REFUSED)
}
 
Problem is that only 1 of the 2 DNS servers are responding to queries
Looks like 10.0.0.89 is either not a DNS server at all, or it is down

Commands: {
   cat /var/lib/dhclient/dhclient--eth0.lease
}

DHCP lease shows that both DNS servers were provided by the DHCP server
I am assuming that 10.0.0.89 is meant to be a DNS server so need to investigate why it will not provide DNS responses

SSH to either DNS server fails
Investigation shows ssh keys are not correct
Loaded the provided key to my ssh directory

Commands: {
   cd /home/ec2-user/.ssh
   vim testKey
      (paste key from netadm-candidate-20190404-cschnell.pem)
	   :wq
	   chmod 600 testKey
	   ssh ec2-user@10.0.0.89 -i testKey
}

Have never used an Amazon Linux server so I had to dig a bit to figure out the file structures.

Commands: {
   find / -name named.conf
   cd /var/lib/docker/overlay2/173f90e0ed3478ffc8a823af04b7a482c8c1581408810eaaa8144d89fc0f8f0f/merged/etc/bind
}

Comparing the named.conf file between .89 and .235, the .89 file is different 
(Missing the ACL statements for RFC1918 addresses as well as having recursion disabled)

Commands: {
   (Make a backup and move the named.conf file on .89)
   mv named.conf named.conf.bak
   vim named.conf
   (paste in text from the named.conf file from .235)
   :wq
}

Rebooted server to force changes to take effect
(could not figure out how to just restart the bind process only)

Resolution:
10.0.0.89 had a misconfigured named.conf file. Replaced it with the working file from .235/github and name resolution started working
